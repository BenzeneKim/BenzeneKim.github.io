# ShiftTouch
Multiple Input Area while Reducing Screen Occlusion

![Concept](/assets/images/shift_touch/Concept_of_ShiftTouch.png)

# Introduction
The contributions of this paper are as follows.
- We propose a passive and tangible interface, which can be combined with varioustypes of kinesthetic feedback,reduces screen occlusion by up to 80.5% compared to conventional touch extension interfaces.
- We present an interface structure to control fne touch coordinates and investigate the optimal electrode parameters for
the interface.
- We demonstrate applications for various form factors implemented using the ShiftTouch technique.
- We analyze preliminary user feedback to clarify the advantages along with the remaining challenges.
